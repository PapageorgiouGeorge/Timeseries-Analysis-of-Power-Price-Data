# Timeseries-Analysis-of-Power-Price-Data:-Exploring-Correlation-Integrals,-Embedding-Dimensions,-Lyapunov-Spectra,-and-Kolmogorov-Entropy-at-Different-Sampling-Rates
In this comprehensive analysis, our primary objectives encompass a multifaceted exploration of the power-price timeseries data, consisting of 8160 data points. We endeavor to achieve the following: 
1) Craft a timeseries graph.
2) Determine the appropriate time delay.
3) Construct a phase portrait graph.
4) Calculate and visualize correlation integrals.
5) Generate a graph depicting the correlation dimension versus embedding dimension while estimating fractal, minimum, and essential embedding dimensions.
6) Calculate and present the Lyapunov spectrum graph.
7) Compute the Kolmogorov entropy, with an optional associated graph. Furthermore, we shall convert the original timeseries from an hourly to a 4-hour sampling rate, aggregating 2190 points, and subsequently repeat the aforementioned procedure. 
8) Provide an insightful commentary on the observed differences and similarities between the two distinct cases.
